`z_getbalance` refuses an address the wallet does not hold; post-quantum keys filed when paid
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`z_getbalance` refuses a transparent address the wallet does not hold (ECC or post-quantum: no key and no watch-only
script) with `From address does not belong to this node, transparent or post-quantum key or watch-only script not
found.` (`RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY`); a watch-only address still answers, and a foreign shielded address is refused
with `From address does not belong to this node, spending key or viewing key not found.`. A post-quantum key of the
wallet that receives a `TX_PQPKH` output without an address-book entry is filed (purpose `receive`), so a seed-only
restore treats its receipts as receipts, not change; a fresh YED holder key is filed when drawn. Where Yellowback is
live, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listaddresses` and `validateaddress` mark a YED holder key with `"yed_holder": true`.
